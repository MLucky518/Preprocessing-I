        <h3>About Me <h3>
        
          <p> I am a hard working dedicated father of three who is currently attending Lambda School for Full Stack Web Development. Most of my work history has been in a production or warehouse setting, but i am looking for a job in the tech field. Before attending Lambda, i was a self taught java programmer for almost two years, and in that time gained valuable knowlege and acumen for the type of work i am interested in. I am a very capable learner and pride myself on the work that i have completed in my field. If hired i can be expected to always deliver timely quality work, to work well with my peers, and to learn new technologies at a moments notice. All of my relevant work informatiion and skills are included in this resume, but for a more comprehensive look on what i am working on please visit my personal website, the link is included above.  </p>
